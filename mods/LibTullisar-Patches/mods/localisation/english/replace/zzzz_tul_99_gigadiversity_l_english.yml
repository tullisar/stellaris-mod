 lifeless_methane:0 "Lifeless Methane World"
 lifeless_methane_desc:0 "This world has a very hazy atmosphere of nitrogen-methane. Mountains of water ice and liquid methane dominate the landscape. The world is habitable for those suited for methane based life that thrives in the chilling cold of such a world. Since it lacks any natural life, food is harder to grow, but mining operations can be done without having to worry about a biosphere getting in the way."
 
 lifeless_ammonia:0 "Lifeless Ammonia World"
lifeless_ammonia_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-ammonia atmosphere. This planet's variable gas is ammonia. With much higher atmospheric pressure than most terrestrial planets, the ammonia hydrosphere is stable. This planet is habitable for Ammonia breathing lifeforms."

 lifeless_ash:0 "Lifeless Ash World"
 lifeless_ash_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-carbon dioxide-sulfur dioxide atmosphere. Although this young world has cooled from its molten past it still has considerable seismic and volcanic activity. The atmosphere on this planet is toxic to most creatures."
 
 lifeless_sulfur:0 "Lifeless Sulfur World"
lifeless_sulfur_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-sulfur atmosphere. This planet's variable gas is a mix of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. High amounts of widely spread out volcanic activity causes the surface to be covered in thousands of sulfur hot springs."

 lifeless_ocean:0 "Lifeless Ocean World"
